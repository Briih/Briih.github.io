        Miss Eileen Dover <br> 4321 Cliff Top Edge <br> Dover, CT9 XXX <br> UK <br> Re: Eileen Dover university application <br> Dear Eileen,
        <br> Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to
        <br> study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following
        <br> sections.
        <br> Starting dates
        <br> We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any more, however it would suit
        <br> us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for cach one are as
        <br> follows:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
        <br> You can find more information about important university dates on our website
        <br> Subject of study
        <br> At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility – as long as the
        <br> subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent,
        <br> dedicated research, and just the kind of person we’d like to have on our team. Saying that, of the
        <br> ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
            <li>>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30°C
                <br> (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 > 3 x 104.)</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <br> So please con you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you’d
        <br> expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we’d
        <br> need to know? Thanks.
        <br> Exotic dance moves
        <br> Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer
        <br> your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        <br> Polynesian chicken dance
        <br> A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would
        <br> dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be “fruitful”.
        <br> Icelandic brownian shuffle
        <br> Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice
        <br> this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling
        <br> their bodies around in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow
        <br> students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as twerking.
        <br> Arctic robot dance
        <br> An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed
        <br> to have discovered a new dance style characterized by “robotic”, stilted movements, being
        <br> practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was
        <br> discovered that they just moving like this because they were really cold.
        <br> For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.
        <br> Yours sincerely.
        <br>
        <br>
