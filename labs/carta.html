        <h3>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h3>
        Dear Eileen, <br>
        <br> Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part
        <br> of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.

        <h3>Starting dates</h3>
        We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any more, however it would suit us better if you
        <br> could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for cach one are as follows:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
        <br>
        <br> You can find more information about <ins>important university dates</ins> on our website

        <h3>Subject of study</h3>
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility – as long as the subjects fall
        <br> somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated research, and just
        <br> the kind of person we’d like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued
        <br> by are as follows, in order of priority:
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the
                <br> audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 > 3 x 104.)</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <br> So please con you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you’d expect the
        <br> research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we’d need to know? Thanks.

        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,
        <br> my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        <br>
        <br> Polynesian chicken dance
        <div>
            A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around
            <br> in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be “fruitful”.
        </div>
        Icelandic brownian shuffle
        <div>
            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
            <br> involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably
            <br> tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired
            <br> modern styles such as twerking.
        </div>
        Arctic robot dance
        <div>
            An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
            <br> discovered a new dance style characterized by “robotic”, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants
            <br> of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they just moving like this
            <br> because they were really cold.
        </div>
        <br> For more of my research, see my <ins>exotic dance research page</ins> .
        <br>
        <br> Yours sincerely.
        <br>
        <br>
